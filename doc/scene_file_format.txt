# Available sections are "animations", "lights", "flat", "camera_animation" and "models".
# A section is started with square brackets:
[animations]
# Animation paths neeeds to be created first!

# ---
# There's an invisible char that could be used as a divisor - that char is pipe (|)
# ---

# Animations are loaded with at least four (4!) positions, according to:
#	x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3 x4 y4 z4 period
# ... Where all fields are floats
# Following is an example:
80 50 40 | -80.0 55 40 |-70.0 80 -10 | -2 10 -7 | -10 7 -40 | -5  50 -15 | -20.0 80.0 -8.0 | 100.0  70.0 -10.0 | 100.0

# This animation path is assigned ID=0 since it's the first created
# Each animation path is then assigned id=1,2,3...

# The following section specifies which animation path the camera should follow by default
[camera_animation]
# The format is:
#	id_to_follow start_point | id_to_look_at start_point
# Example that follows an animation path and looks at the same path but further ahead
0 5 | 0 40

# This specifies light sources that is not supposed to be attached to a model
[lights]
# The format is:
# 	xPos yPos zPos | Red Green Blue
-50 10 0 | 1.0 0.7 0.5


[models]
# Models are loaded using the following syntax:
# 	/path/to/model | rotX rotY rotZ | Xpos Ypos Zpos | scale | animation_path_id start_animation | nr_of_lights

# Light sources attatched to models are placed directly after given model and loaded according to:
# 	relativeXpos relativeYpos relativeZpos R G B

# If animation path is equal to -1 - no animation path is chosen

# Example, without animation path and light sources: 
res/models/sponza/sponza.obj 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 | 0.1 | -1 0 0


# This will start a new section for loading flat-shaded models.
[flat]
# Light sources attatched to models are placed directly after given model and loaded according to:
# 	relativeXpos relativeYpos relativeZpos R G B

# Exemple, with animation path and light source attached:
res/models/cube/cube.obj 0 0 0 | 1 1 1 | 0.5 | 0 0 | 1
0 0 0 | 1.0 1.0 0.2
