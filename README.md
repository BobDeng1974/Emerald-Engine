Emerald Engine
--------
3D graphics engine written in C++ using OpenGL. This project was first created as part of a course
in computer graphics at Link√∂ping University. Grass, shadows, bloom and more was added as in a
later course.

Many parts of this project have been based on tutorials and examples found online, [learnopengl.com](http://www.learnopengl.com) in particular has been a good source of inspiration. The grass was
inspired by this [blog post](http://outerra.blogspot.se/2012/05/procedural-grass-rendering.html).

Project members:
 - Hans-Filip Elo
 - Lage Ragnarsson
 - Isak Wiberg
