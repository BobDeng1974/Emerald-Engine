# Available sections are "flat" and "models".
# A section is started with:
[models]
# Models are loaded using the following syntax:
# /path/to/model rotX rotY rotZ Xpos Ypos Zpos scale nr_of_lights
res/models/nanosuit/nanosuit.obj 0 5 0 20 0 -5 1 0
res/models/nanosuit/nanosuit.obj 0 0 0 -8 0 -5 1 0
# Now we have loaded three nanosuits

# This will start a new section for loading flat-shaded models.
[flat]
# Light sources attatched to models are placed directly after given model and loaded according to:
# relativeXpos relativeYpos relativeZpos R G B
